# Codeforces 810 Div 2

## A - Perfect Permutation

The minimal weight of any permutation is atleast one since 1 divides any integer (so 1 divides p<sub>1</sub>).

Ex1:<br/>
n 1 2 3 4 ... n-1 (since k+1 doesn't divide k)

Ex2:<br/>
if n is one  - 1<br/>
elif n is odd  - 1 3 2 5 4 ... n n-1<br/>
elif n is even - 2 1 4 3 6 ... n n-1<br/>

## B - Party
