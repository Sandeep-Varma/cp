# CSES Introductory Problems

## Weird Algorithm

Assert whether n is even or odd using the % operator and transform n accordingly. This can be repeated untill n is not one using a while loop.

## Missing Number

Create an array of length n of boolenan type where value at each index indicating the presence or absence of that index in the given list. Iterate over the list of given numbers and set value at those indices to true. Then, the only position in the array not containing true is the missing number

## Repititions

Iterate over the string character by character and store the previous character, previous contiguous length and maximum previous contiguous character length. Increment the length if the character is same as its predecessor else make it zero. After the computation at each character, update the previous maximum contiguous character length.

## Increasing Array

Iterate over the array left to right and at every position, if the value is lower than its predecessor, then increment it to make them equal as that's the minimum increment to be done.
